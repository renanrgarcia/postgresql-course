# Memory

- Memory is a critical resource in PostgreSQL, as it directly affects the performance of the database.
- PostgreSQL uses memory for various purposes, including caching data, managing connections, and executing queries.
- `Local memory` is used for each backend process, while `shared memory` is used for inter-process communication and caching.
- PostgreSQL uses a `shared buffer` pool to cache frequently accessed data pages, reducing the need to read from disk.

## Shared Memory

- As the PostgreSQL server starts new backend processes, it allocates shared memory for inter-process communication and caching.
  - It stores data pages, transaction logs, and other shared resources.
- It permits multiple backend processes to access the same data without duplicating it in each process's local memory.
- This memory is composed of several components:
  - `Shared Buffers`: The main cache for data pages.
  - `WAL Buffers`: Used for Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) to ensure data integrity.
  - `Lock Table`: Manages locks for concurrent access to database objects.
  - `Background Writer`: Periodically writes dirty pages from shared buffers to disk.

### Shared Buffers

- They work as a cache for all I/O operations, reducing the need to read from disk.
- Frequently accessed data pages are stored in shared buffers, allowing faster access for subsequent queries.
- They mantains a balance between memory usage and performance, as too small a buffer can lead to increased disk I/O, while too large a buffer can consume excessive memory resources.
- The size of shared buffers can be configured in the `postgresql.conf` file using the `shared_buffers` parameter.

### WAL Buffers

- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) buffers are used to store changes made to the database before they are written to disk.
- This ensures data integrity and durability in case of a crash.
- They optimize write operations by batching changes and writing them to disk in larger chunks.
- The size of WAL buffers can also be configured in the `postgresql.conf` file using the `wal_buffers` parameter.

## Local Memory

- Each backend process has its own local memory for executing queries and managing connections.
- Local memory is used for:
  - Query execution plans.
  - Temporary tables and data structures.
  - Sorting and hashing operations.
- Can be configured in the `postgresql.conf` file using parameters like `work_mem` (memory for sorting and hashing) and `maintenance_work_mem` (memory for maintenance operations like VACUUM and CREATE INDEX).

### Work Buffers

- `work_mem` is the amount of memory allocated for each query operation, such as sorting and hashing.
- It is used to store intermediate results during query execution.

### Maintenance Work Buffers

- `maintenance_work_mem` is the memory allocated for maintenance operations like VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE.
- It is used to optimize these operations by allowing them to use more memory for better performance.
- Increasing this value can speed up maintenance tasks, especially on large tables.

## Transaction Memory

- PostgreSQL uses memory to manage transactions, including:
  - Transaction logs (WAL) for durability. `wal_level` can be set to control the amount of information logged. `wal_keep_segments` can be configured to retain a certain number of WAL segments.
  - Locks for concurrency control.
  - Transaction state information.
- Each transaction has its own memory context, which is used to store temporary data and state information.

### OS Cache

- The operating system also uses its own cache to store frequently accessed data pages.
- PostgreSQL relies on the OS cache to improve performance by reducing disk I/O.
