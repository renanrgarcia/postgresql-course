# Database params

- `Database parameters` are settings that control the behavior of the PostgreSQL server and its performance.
- Configured in the `postgresql.conf` file, which is located in the data directory of the PostgreSQL installation.
  - Can also be set at `pg_hba.conf` for connection-specific settings and `pg_ident.conf` for user mapping.

## Parameters

- `listening_address`
  - Specifies the IP address(es) on which the PostgreSQL server listens for incoming connections.
  - Default is `localhost`, meaning it only accepts connections from the local machine.
  - Can be set to `*` to listen on all available interfaces.
  - `::` and `0.0.0.0` means all IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, respectively.
  - Empty list: only accepts Unix domain socket connections.
- `temp_buffers`
  - Specifies the amount of memory allocated for temporary files used by queries that require more memory than available in `work_mem`.
  - Default is `8MB`.
  - Can be increased for large queries that require sorting or hashing.
- `max_connections`
  - Sets the maximum number of concurrent connections to the PostgreSQL server.
  - Default is `100`.
  - Increasing this value allows more clients to connect simultaneously but requires more system resources.
  - Should be set based on the expected workload and available system memory.
- `shared_buffers`
  - Specifies the amount of memory allocated for shared buffers, which is used to cache frequently accessed data pages.
  - Default is `128MB`.
  - Increasing this value can improve performance by reducing disk I/O, especially for read-heavy workloads.
  - Should be set based on the total available memory and workload characteristics.
- `work_mem`
  - Specifies the amount of memory allocated for each query operation, such as sorting and hashing.
  - Default is `4MB`.
  - Increasing this value can improve performance for complex queries that require more memory for intermediate results.
  - Should be set based on the expected query complexity and available system memory.
- `maintenance_work_mem`
  - Specifies the amount of memory allocated for maintenance operations like VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE.
  - Default is `64MB`.
  - Increasing this value can speed up maintenance tasks, especially on large tables.
  - Should be set based on the expected size of maintenance operations and available system memory.
- `autovacuum_work_mem`
  - Specifies the amount of memory allocated for the autovacuum process, which automatically cleans up dead tuples and reclaims space.
  - Default is `-1`, meaning it uses the value of `maintenance_work_mem`.
  - Can be increased for large tables to improve autovacuum performance.
- `effective_cache_size`
  - Provides an estimate of the amount of memory available for caching data pages, including both shared buffers and the operating system cache.
  - Default is `4GB`.
  - Helps the query planner make better decisions about whether to use indexes or perform sequential scans.
  - Should be set based on the total available memory and expected workload characteristics.
