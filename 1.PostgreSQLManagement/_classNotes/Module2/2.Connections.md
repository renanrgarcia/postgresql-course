# Connections

- `Connection process`:
  - Client application initiates a connection to the PostgreSQL server (pgAdmin, psql, DBeaver, etc.).
  - Server accepts the connection and creates a new backend process for the client (Postmaster).
  - The backend process handles all requests from the client until the connection is closed.
- The client needs to provide:
  - `Hostname or IP address` of the PostgreSQL server.
  - `Port number` (default is 5432).
  - `Database name` to connect to.
  - `Username` and `Password` for authentication.
- PostgreSQL supports various authentication methods, including:
  - `Password authentication`: Requires a username and password.
  - `Peer authentication`: Uses the operating system user for authentication.
  - `Certificate authentication`: Uses SSL certificates for secure connections.
  - `GSSAPI/Kerberos authentication`: Uses Kerberos for secure authentication.
- The authentication method is configured in the `pg_hba.conf` file, which specifies which users can connect to which databases and from which hosts.
- `Maximum number of connections` can be configured in the `postgresql.conf` file using the `max_connections` parameter.
- `Closing connections`:
  - When a client disconnects, the backend process is terminated.
  - Resources used by the backend process are released back to the system.
  - PostgreSQL can also handle idle connections, which are connections that are not actively executing queries but remain open for future use.

## Polling Connections

- PostgreSQL allows for polling connections to check the status of a connection without blocking.
- Tools like pgBouncer and pgPool can be used to manage connection pooling and reduce the overhead of establishing new connections.
- Connection pooling allows multiple client connections to share a smaller number of backend processes, improving performance and resource utilization.

## Connect to cluster

- To connect to a PostgreSQL cluster, you can use the `psql` command-line tool or any PostgreSQL client application.

```bash
su - postgres # Switch to the postgres user
psql # Connect to the default database (usually 'postgres')
```

- Other ways to connect include:
  - Using `pgAdmin`: A web-based GUI tool for managing PostgreSQL databases.
  - Using `DBeaver`: A universal database management tool that supports PostgreSQL.
  - Using programming languages with PostgreSQL drivers (e.g., Python with psycopg2, Java with JDBC).

## Practice

- `ps aux | grep postgres` to check running PostgreSQL processes.
  - Or `top -u postgres` to see PostgreSQL processes in real-time, but with less detail.
